Contributing

If you want to learn about bash, git, and want to contribute to the game, here is a list of ideas:

* Improving how health potions work
* Expand on levels and experience
* Expand high score list to include more information
* Introduce some sort of overworld and/or places to visit in addition to battles
* Way to host on the internet reliably (Windows netcat?)
